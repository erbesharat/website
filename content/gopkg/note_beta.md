Gopkg.link is currently in beta and is provided for free for all users.

For the stable release various pricing tiers will be available including a minimal free tier.  
Advanced tiers will feature usage statistics, monitoring and more.  

To enable even more projects and the go community to use the service for free we are looking for sponsors.  
Please get in touch at gopkg@seetheprogress.net.
