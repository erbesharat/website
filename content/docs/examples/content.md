TXTDirect is using DNS TXT records to store data and keeps you in control of your own data.


In the examples "txtdirect.example.com" is your hosted TXTDirect instance.

It is recommended to use CNAMEs to reference this instance, where possible.

For more details on the actual spec take a look at our [TXT-record specification](/docs/specification/).
