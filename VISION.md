# Vision
TXTDirect Website is a community project. From our current viewpoint, its role is:
Community website to showcase TXTDirect.



## Communication
A lot of discussion about TXTDirect Website happens within Github issues. Ideally, we will keep it that way until TXTDirect Website becomes big enough that this turns into a problem. The advantages of this is that all documentation and issues are publicly searchable and easily linked to the source code.

## Contributions
The TXTDirect Website project should always aim to devote a lot of time to making contributors feel like an important part of the community. We should strive to provide a place for anyone to be able to contribute. The aim of the core team should be to work on ways to showcase contributions, encourage adoption and show off great work. An example of where this worked is the [CocoaPods Quality Index](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods.org-Two-point-Five/).
